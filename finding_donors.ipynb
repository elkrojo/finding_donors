    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "## Preparing the Data\n",
    "Before data can be used as input for machine learning algorithms, it often must be cleaned, formatted, and restructured — this is typically known as **preprocessing**. Fortunately, for this dataset, there are no invalid or missing entries we must deal with, however, there are some qualities about certain features that must be adjusted. This preprocessing can help tremendously with the outcome and predictive power of nearly all learning algorithms."

    "### Transforming Skewed Continuous Features\n",
    "A dataset may sometimes contain at least one feature whose values tend to lie near a single number, but will also have a non-trivial number of vastly larger or smaller values than that single number.  Algorithms can be sensitive to such distributions of values and can underperform if the range is not properly normalized. With the census dataset two features fit this description: '`capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`. \n",

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "### Support Vector Machine    \n",
    "\n",
    "**Application:**    Support Vector Machine is used by financial institutions for stock market forecasting. In this setting the algorithm is used to compare stock performance relative to other stocks in the same sector. Institutions use this classification technique to manage investment decisions.    \n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths:**    Support Vector Machine performs well with datasets containing a large number of features (highly dimensional). It is very well suited to datasets where the number of features is greater than the number of samples. The algorithm is very low on memory demands, using subsets of the training set to fit the model (support vectors).    \n",
    "\n",
    "**Weaknesses:**    Large datasets slow this algoritm down due to increased training time. It does not perform well with noisy data where target classes overlap.    \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Choose?:**    Since the data set contains 103 features after one-hot encoding, I think this makes it a good candidate for SVM classifier algorithm. Even though the dataset is large, it is not prohibitively large for this experiment.    \n",
    "\n",
    "### Random Forest    \n",
    "\n",
    "**Application:**    In banking, Random Forest is used to assess risk of loan applicants. In the automobile industry, this algorithm is used to to predict the failure rate of parts. In healthcare, this algorithm is used to predict the likelyhood of a patient developing a chronic disease. It is used in speech recognition software to predict speech patterns.    \n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths:**    Random Forest does not suffer from the overfitting associated with decision tree. This algorithm is robust to noisy data and hence quite versatile to all types of classification tasks. Random Forest does not require too much tuning to get good results. Works well with large data sets.    \n",
    "\n",
    "**Weaknesses:**    Analysing the results of Random Forest is difficult to interpret compared to decision tree. Real time applications suffer under workload assosiated with large number of decision trees in a Random Forest. In dealing with categorical variables, categories with higher dimensionality are given preferential treatment. For regression tasks, Random Forest will not predict outside the range of the training data.    \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Choose?:**    Since the data set is quite noisy in nature, I think that Random Forest can navigate this data effectively. The size of the dataset containing over 45,000 samples, also makes it a contender for Random Forest.    \n",
    "\n",
    "### Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "**Application:**    Logistic Regression is used to predict the performance of a candidate in a political election. The algorithm is also used to predict how likely a voter is to vote for a particular candidate. In text Logistic Regression is used to classify word types eg. noun, verb, adjective, etc. In weather forecasting it is used to predict the probability of rain. In banking it is used to predict likelyhood of someone defaulting on an account.    \n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths:**    Analysing the results is an easy process. The independent variables in a Logistic Regression task are not required to be normally distributed, and this makes the algorithm very robust. No linear relationship is assumed between dependent and independent variables, which makes the algorithm insensitive to non-linear effects.    \n",
    "\n",
    "**Weaknesses:**    In cases where training data is sparse and highly dimensional, Logistic Regression may have a tendency to overfit the training data. Continuous outcomes are not compatible with this algorithm eg. Predicting how heavily it rains. The algorithm can make low resolution predictions eg. Heavy or Low rainfall at the expense of precision of the model. This algorithm requires a minimum of 50 data points to produce stable outcomes making it unsuitable for smaller experiments.    \n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Choose?:**    The data set is sufficiently populated to get stable results. This algorithm will allow me to determine which variables are most corellated with the outcome.\n",

    "Of the three models I have preliminarily tested, I will be selecting Logistic Regression for the task of identifying potential donors who earn an amount greater than 50,000 per year. The Logistic Regression classifier has outperformed the others in many areas, most notably where it achieved an f-score (beta=0.5) close to 0.7 on the full training set. In terms of time cost, the algorithm is performing exceptionally quick. About 1 second in the training phase and less than 1 second for prediction taking the full training set. The algorithm appears to be well suited to the data returning an accuracy score above 0.8 on the testing set taking 1 percent, 10 percent, and 100 percent of the training set."

    "Logistic Regression uses probability to predict if a person is categorized in either of two ways. For our purposes, people who earn more than 50,000 per year are assigned a value of 1, and people who earn 50,000 or less are assigned a value of 0. When the model is presented with new unseen data without an income variable, it will calculate a probability of each observation falling into either category from the existing features available. In our case, these features would be the following - Age, Working Class, Level of Education, Marital Status, etc. Probability values below 0.5 will be assigned a 0 value and those above 0.5 will be assigned a value of 1.    \n",
    "\n",
    "The first step when developing the model is to train it on data where the income variable is present. From here the model compares each feature against the income variable and measures the relationship between each pairing. Following this process each feature is given a probability score for producing either of the two outcomes. At the prediction stage each prediction observation is assigned an total probability by adding up all associated probabilities present which were generated at the training stage. This total probability is then dividing by the number of values present in the observation to give the final probability score.    \n",

    "The results of the feature importance attribute for this model only contained two of the features I had speculated, those being 'Monetary Capital Gains' and 'Average Hours Worked Per Week'. The top 2 features 'Monetary Capital Losses' and 'Age' did not feature in my list. I did include 'Monetary Capital Gains' but had it listed lower in level of importance at position 5. 'Average Hours Worked Per Week' occupies the same position as my list. 'Number of educational years completed' I had not considered for inclusion.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the real results, it makes a lot of sense that 'Monetary Capital Losses' would occupy the top spot. You could imagine people without enough income to pay bills borrowing to maintain their lifestyle. People earning below 50,000 per year are more likely to have more debt relative to earnings. 'Age' seems appropriate in hindsight. Not many young people are going to be earning above 50,000. That amount would be more associated with people between the ages of 30 and 60 I would guess. 'Number of educational years completed' also seems relevant considering higher education corellates to higher earnings."

    "### Feature Selection\n",
    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "The accuracy score using all features is 0.8419. The accuracy score utilizing only the top 5 most important features is 0.8055. That eqautes to a loss of approximately 3.6% on accuracy when it comes to classifying the outcomes correctly. That is really not a lot and still above 80% correctly classified. The F-score using all features is 0.6831. The F-score utilizing the top 5 most important features is 0.5898. That equates to a loss of almost 10% on the F-score. This loss in F-score appears to be rather significant. I would side against using the reduced features when training the model as a 10% loss brings the F-score below 60% on the precision/recall average."
